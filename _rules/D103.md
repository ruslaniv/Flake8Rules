A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a function and acts as documentation. All functions should have docstrings.

### Anti-pattern

```python
def add(a, b):
    pass
```

### Best practice

```python
def add(a, b):
    """The sum of two numbers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int, float
        Description of a parameter
    b : int, float
        Description of a parameter

    Returns
    -------
    int
      Description of a return value
   """
```
